      "text": "4A. Module 4\nAs Factions settle the solar system and adopt a commodity economy based upon isotope rocket fuel, humanity changes and augments itself to adapt to the space environment of low gravity and high radiation.\nThe science of cybernetics allows human-machine hybrids to flourish. Terawatt technology makes it possible to build a starship and augmented humanity makes it possible to expand to the stars. Module 4 Exodus plays with multiplayer and solitaire scenarios and only needs the Core High Frontier 4 game to play, but can be combined with any Module. It expands High Frontier in scope but not in length:\na. Contracts (All Games). Enhance the early to mid-game, granting early Aqua and mission goals.\nb. New Spaceborn Colonist Queue (Modules 1 & 2) represent Humans born in space whose bodies have atrophied to the point that they are largely mechanical.\nc. Augmentation Chits (Modules 1 & 2) are gained by completing contracts and played on Colonists to upgrade them and allow them to Promote and be Promoted.\nd. Enterprises (Modules 1 & 2) are another path to augmentations, as humanity alters itself and its machines to better colonize the solar system and reach the stars.\ne. New Solitaire Political Diagram (Module 0) to integrate contracts with the CEO and altruism solitaire variants.\nf. An Isobank, founded by one player and holding the game’s repository of isotope fusion fuel, becomes the center of starship construction. With Module 3, the isobank can be raided and potentially robbed! If a starshot occurs, either in the spirit of expansion1 or to escape from bondage,2 a combination game into Interstellar is possible.\n1WHY GO AD ASTRA? Each of us has a drive to spread one’s wings that has been reinforced by eons of natural selection. This instinct, rather than “population pressures”, will impel a pioneering minority to the stars. Earth is never going to run out of living space, as this is being written, the global population increase is plummeting at a rate such that the population max will be achieved this century. Meanwhile, technological advances continue to shrink the ecological footprint, the number of hectares per person that each of us requires for our food and other needs. A simple application of arcology and high tech farming would provide more living space than the vastness of space could provide for centuries, because of what it takes to make such places habitable.\n2EXODUS refers to a mass departure of refugees, as originally accounted in the second book of the Torah and of the Old Testament. The warrefugee scenarios in this Module describe a postwar interstellar exodus comparable to the flight of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt about 3.5 kya."

Reminder that this may make the final starshot a desperate one.\n4EARTHBORN vs. SPACEBORN. A person born on Earth is acclimated to a 1 gee planet or Bernal. A person who has spent years in a low gravity rocket or world suffers from muscular atrophy to the point where they would need a lot of bionic help to take a vacation on Earth. As the future unfolds, humans may specialize into two kinds of cybernetic augmentations: mental aids, such as an exocortex or wearable computers, and physical aids, such as bionic limbs, locomotion, and life-support, all of which allow acrobatic performance in zero-gee.\nTIP: Because contracts require boosting, there is more boosting in a Module 4 game and consequently the Player White NASA Faction\nPrivilege (with a boosting bonus) is at an advantage.\nThis Faction is recommended for beginning players.

This event is applied to both Colonist queues plus the contract decks (4A5b), including the Exodus contract deck if it is active (4C2c).\nb. Contract Fulfillment (add to G). This new free action moves a completed contract card from a Stack to adjacent to your playmat. Completed contracts are called enterprises (4B8).\nc. Negotiation Summary (add to N). Possession of contract cards can be negotiated only if unfulfilled. Some fulfilled contract Abilities may be negotiable, if specified. Augmentation chits are not negotiable. Fulfilled contract icons may be shared (see partnership delegates, 4B8).\nd. Fundraise Operation (O2 of Module 0). During this Operation, a partner delegate can be placed on an enterprise per 4B8b in order to increase your portfolio. As the final step of this Operation, you may cycle a contract deck and may start a contract auction (4B3).\ne. FINAO (H7e). Failure Is Not An Option cost changes after isotope monetization (3B5).\nf. Isobank Stacks (add to E3). This is a new Stack created by construction of the isobank (4C). Its location for all players is indicated by the single isobank/starship token.\ng. Miner Colonist Profession (2C1a). During a site refuel operation (I5), you may perform one extra refuel per Colocated miner present. The refuels may be of different types (you may receive 1 isotope and 7 water, for instance.) h. Exomigration (2A6). There are 2 queues instead of 1: earthborn and Robot/spaceborn (4A5e). During any exomigration, you must choose whether to join the Spacer Union (4D2) or not. If you do, exomigrate the top card from the Robot/spaceborn queue, but if you do not, take the top card from the earthborn queue. If you ever exomigrate a Robot/spaceborn, you must Decommission all your earthborns and vice versa. Regardless if you hold Robot/spaceborn Colonists, or Human Colonists, your Colonist limit is equal to the number of anchored Bernals (doubled for promoted Bernals, see 2Ca).\ni. Robot Exomigration (2A6). If multiple Robots are drawn during a single exomigration (2C2a), choose one to keep and Discard the rest, then shuffle the spaceborn queue.\nj. Ad Astra Futures (1D1b). If one of these Futures are accomplished with any TW thrusters, promoted Freighters, and/or promoted Bernals present (whether required or not), set aside the corresponding medals.\nThey are not rewarded during Exodus scoring (4E3c). (The ad astra points replace the medals.) Any isotope present is Decommissioned but set aside per 4C4a so that it can be counted in the endgame.\n8 | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | MODULE 4 - EXODUS k. Promotion (1A5 / 2A3). Promotion is the same as in Modules 1 and 2, except a Colonist (or Colonists) of yours must be present implanted with a certain number of unique augmentation chits (4D7e).\nl. Anchoring (2A5). Anchoring the “Lofstrom Loop” or “GEO Space Elevator” Bernals at a location which activates the “HOME” Ability requires an Epic Hazard Roll (1A6), with the Bernal supports as the unit(s) performing the roll."

This term refers to the Space on the map where you store your Aqua and/or gold beads, except that gold beads are stored at the isobank if one exists (4C2). Your Bank is located in LEO, a Home Bernal (2B3), or (if Module 3) an ET Home Bernal (3F1), whichever is furthest from Earth. You may only have one Bank at a time.\nb. Powersat Stacking (clarification). Modifications to the Powersat push value are limited to +1 maximum (total push +2), except for the MagBeam robonaut (which always gets a total push of +3 thrust regardless of Powersat push value).\nc. Multiple Rerolls (clarification). If multiple Abilities and/or rules grant rerolls for a particular roll, you may reroll once per such Ability/rule. After a reroll, you decide whether to keep it or roll again (if possible).\nd. Site Descriptions (clarification). Some cards in this Module use new methods of describing Sites:\n• Unexplored: A Site without a claim disk or busted disk.\n• Flyby Space: A Space with a flyby bonus printed on the map, including solar oberth flyby (H8e).\n• Signposted: Any Site with a colored route leading to it.\n• Space Elevator: A Site connected to an elevator path printed on the map (e.g. phobos), or to an Anchored GEO Space Elevator (1B9e).\ne. Dropstone Sites (Clarification):5\n• Any Synodic Comet (multiple locations).\n• Jovian Himalia Moonlets (elara, leda, himala, lysithea: 10:10 F).\n5TERRAFORMING LUNA. The only world that can be terraformed in High Frontier timescales is Luna. If a catcher station is located on the lunar farside, one unintended consequence of the kinetic energy (possibly augmented by protium fusion) from dropstone impacts would be to give Luna an oxygen atmosphere ten times the atmospheric pressure on Mars. Thus, strangely, a terraformed Luna is caused by pollution rather than deliberate effort. Even if fusion operations were to cease, its atmosphere would linger for centuries.\nEASILY MISSED (MODULE 2):\nIf you fail the Epic Hazard Roll, the Bernal supports are Decommissioned and the Bernal is not Anchored.\n[4A6k]\n• Saturnian Norse Moonlets (thrymr, ymir, phoebe, skoll, suttungr: 9:10 G).\n• Saturnian Moon Methone (9:00 G).\n• Uranian Sycorax Group (setebos, sycorax, prospero: 9:10 H).\n• Comet. Any Site with “Comet” in the name or map label.\nf. Ownership (Clarification). References to tokens and Stack items (cards, FTs, etc.) apply to those that you own or which you have permission to use (through negotiation, Freedom to Roam, Felony, etc.), except:\n• “Any player’s” means any such item regardless of permission.\n• “Your” means only items that are in your Playmat or are in your player color.\ng. Order of Operations (clarification). When performing multiple steps of adding/subtracting and multiplying/dividing, use the following order:\n• Subtraction\n• Division / Multiplication • Addition\n• Round if necessary (up or down as indicated)\nEXAMPLE [4A7f] The Fullerene Cable Spinner contract allows you to ET Produce C cards at “any Factory”; producing such cards at another player’s Factory is not possible without permission. The Robotic Facility contract requires you to factory refuel at “Your Factory”. Even with permission or during the Freedom to Roam Treaty, you cannot fulfill this contract at another player’s Factory.\nAdd diagram of Churynmov-gerasimenko"

Contract Cards\nContract cards have Mass and rad-hardness and are carried in Stacks like other cards in play until their contract is fulfilled and they are stored as enterprises.\na. Not Patents. Contract cards do not count against academia hand limit (I2a) and cannot be sold (I3a).\n6AQUA VS. ISOTOPES. These two commodity currencies differ in their value on Earth. Aqua (water) is not very valuable on Earth, while isotopes (gold beads) are quite valuable as fuel for fusion powerplants. Aqua has no value on Earth’s surface, but does have value in LEO. If you pay the programmers in Aqua, you pay in water orbiting in big cans where the programmers can resell it to outward-bound ships that need propellant.\nMODULE 4 - EXODUS | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | 11 b. Side Matters. When boosting, a contract must be placed on the side (blue-side or gold-side) that was faceup when it was auctioned.\nc. Launch Surety Contracts. Contract cards are immune to pad explosion/space debris events (K2c) or budget cuts events (K2f).\nd. Manned Contracts. If a contract has the “Humans on Board” icon, it is considered Human (see glossary). This is significant for Glitch Repairs, Felony defense, Glory, or as a manned target during combat. It is a Felony to voluntarily Decommission or Discard a manned contract, and if it suffers voluntary Decommission, you suffer default (4B6).\ne. Contract Abilities are of 2 types:\n• When Fulfilling. These Abilities occur once only, as the contract is fulfilled.\n• Fulfilled Ability. These Abilities remain active after the contract is fulfilled and becomes an enterprise (4B8).\nf. Tophat / Felony Stack Abilities (these 2 Abilities are active before fulfillment):\n• Tophat. A Stack containing a contract with the tophat icon can safely enter 1 Hazard per Turn without paying FINAO (the costs are thematically paid for by the billionaire).\n• Felony. A Stack containing a contract with the Felony icon is allowed to commit Felonies (see glossary).\ng. Insight / Bailout “Fulfilled” Abilities:\n• Insight. After announcing a research auction (I2), you may initially choose one patent deck and move its top card to the bottom of its deck. Then choose any top card to auction. You may perform this Ability once per Turn, even if you have Insight from multiple sources. It is inactive during research grants (O5e).\n• Bailout. This Ability grants immunity from budget cuts (K2f). This is negotiable (N7).\nEXAMPLE [4B2e] You win the auction for the Exodus contract “Rival Isobank”. You boost it to your Home Bernal, and take it and 5 isotopes to the listed destination, an opponent’s Bernal at Titan. Because of its “when fulfilling” Ability, you gain 2 isotopes at this Bernal, and 1 more at the isobank. Having fulfilled the contract, you gain the fulfilled Ability, which is to swap 1 isotope for 6 Aqua at your (soon-to-be-built) non-Home Bernal.\nEXAMPLE [4B2g] You gain the insight ability after fulfilling the contract “Hexapod Explorers”. You initiate a research auction, and apply insight to the generator deck, hoping to reveal a pulse generator. But alas, the revealed generator is even worse. You are obliged to research something, so you put a Freighter up for auction.\nFELONY ICON [4B2f]\nTOPHAT ICON [4B2f]\nEASILY MISSED: You can negotiate a late contract.\nThe payments transfer with the card.

You may trade your unfulfilled contract as part of a negotiation (N) replacing your timepiece with your partner’s timepiece and transferring any late fee Aqua on the contract. The contract card may be transferred via cargo transfer (G1), etc.\n• Contract Abilities are not negotiable unless specified.\ni. Fulfilled Contract VP. See 4E2a.\nj. Unfulfilled Contract Penalty. An unfulfilled contract suffers a VP penalty equal to how much you still owe (4E2c).\nk. Cybernetics. These icons are active after a contract is fulfilled and becomes an enterprise (4B8).

Contract Auction (adds to the Fundraise Operation)\nAt the final step of a fundraise operation (O2b), if you do not have an active timepiece for another contract in the Sunspot Cycle, you may perform a contract auction for the top card in a contract deck sharing an Ideology with an Active Law. Before choosing to start the auction, you may Discard the top card from that deck.\na. Partner Enterprise. Whether or not there is a contract auction, a delegate from a fundraise can be used to form a partner enterprise per 4B8a instead of being placed in the Political Assembly.\nb. Auction Prohibition. Contract auctions cannot be held during War/Anarchy.\nc. Deck Selection. After performing the fundraise and associated vote tally (O2a), choose a contract deck sharing an ideology in its ideology pair (4A3e) with an activated law.\n• If the Active Law is in Unity, multiple laws may be activated; otherwise, only one law will be activated.\n• Once the isobank is built (4C2), you may also choose the Exodus contract deck regardless of Active Law.\nd.

[4B3c] EXAMPLE [4B3c] You perform a fundraise while the Active Law is freedom. You add a delegate into equality and move another delegate into equality so that freedom, equality, and unity each have 2 delegates. You examine the contracts, and the honor-unity ideology pair is the best one. Therefore, to break the tied vote tally, you move the Active Law to unity so that you may choose the top honor-unity contract to auction.\nTIP: Freedom/Individuality is almost all-manned (11 of 12); Equality/Authority is somewhat manned (4 of 12); and Honor/Unity is almost all unmanned (1 of 12 manned, 2 of 12 on the gold side). [4B3c]\nMODULE 4 - EXODUS | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | 13 g. Auction Procedure. If you initiate this auction, you must start the bid at 10 years. Then, in any order, players (with an available timepiece of their color) may bid. Continue until no player wishes to lower their bid. The lowest bid is the winner (minimum bid of 0 years).\nh. Ties. As the initiator, the active player wins ties they are involved in. If they are not involved, they choose which of the tied players wins. The Marketeer faction privilege, if active, always wins ties.\ni. 3-step Win Procedure:\n• Deadline. The winner places their timepiece (“sand timer” faceup) into the Sunspot Cycle a number of steps into the future equal to their bid.\n• Cash Up Front. The winner takes the cash advance (4A3h) in Aqua from the Pool.\n• Hand. The winner takes the contract as a Hand Card. It ignores academia hand limits or budget cuts (4B2a,c).\nj. Finder’s Fee. If the auction is won by a player other than the active player, the active player may perform a second Operation on their Turn, which cannot be a fundraise operation (O2b).\nk. Postwar Space Empire (Module 3). If the political assembly has been dissolved (e.g. if a Space Empire (3F5b) is formed), shuffle all the contracts (except Exodus contracts) into a single deck instead of three.

Contract Fulfillment (new free action)\nEach step of a contract’s destination is fulfilled as a free action (G) by moving your Stack containing the contract to the listed destination, while satisfying any other listed conditions. If you fulfill the terms of the contract, move it to a space adjacent to your playmat, and return your timepiece from the Sunspot Cycle placard, which instantly lifts restrictions on contract auctions. Any “Fulfilled:” Abilities of the contract are now active (4B2e).\na. Contract Start. All contracts are put onto the map via the boost operation, boosted to your choice of either LEO or your Home Bernal, see 4A7a). If the contract specifies “Return”, it must be returned to your Bank.\nTIP: Contracts will be put into a Stack on the map via the boost operation (I4).\nSecure a contract before boosting your rocket; that way you can boost both in a single operation. [4B3i]\nEXAMPLE [4B3g] Player Purple places the Search For Life Center contract up for auction, automatically bidding 10 years. Player Red has a contract; their timepiece is in the Sunspot Cycle and so is not available for bidding. Player Green bids 9 years; Player Purple responds with 9 (winning ties as the active player).

Only the most recent announcement for each step is valid.\nd. Return. If your destination specifies “Return,” after reaching the other destinations listed, the Stack must move to your Bank (4A7a) to fulfill.\n• Round Trip. If all other destinations on a contract require cards to be with the contract, the “return” destination also requires the same cards.\ne. Presence. The contract and any other required cards must be at the listed destination or step.\n• Pass Through. If the destination or step includes “Pass through”, the Stack instead must have passed through the listed location this Turn.\nf. Glitch Trigger. Contract fulfillment (including intermediate steps) is a Glitch Trigger.\ng. Contract Added to Your Contracts Fulfilled Area. If this is the last (or only) destination, the contract is fulfilled. Orient/splay the card together with your other fulfilled contracts next to your playmat so that its cybernetics (4A3f) and fulfilled ability (if any, 4A3d) are visible. Return your timepiece to your Reserves and Discard any Aqua from late fees on the contract.\n• Abilities. Any “When Fulfilling:” abilities take place at this point (after removing the contract from its Stack).\n• “Colocated” refers to the contract location at the start of fulfillment (even though the contract is no longer there).\n• “Fulfilled\": These Abilities are now active.\nEXAMPLE [4B4b] A player is completing the “rivalry” contract (visit a Site in a zone with a claimed glory chit & return). She lands in the E\nZone, which has a claimed glory chit, and announces this. On a future Turn, she realizes that the F Zone chit is a better target, so travels to a F Zone Site and announces the landing.

If the commander uses one of the three exits to leave the map, the game ends at the end of the Turn, with scoring per 3G1 and 4E2, including Project Exodus VP for those aboard the starship per 4E3.\n• Starshot. Project Exodus scoring (4E3) is used, using only the fuel, equipment and crew on the exited starship.\n• Jupiter Exception. If the Jupiter-Sol-Jupiter exit is used, move the starship to the solar oberth (H8e) (but don’t apply its crash Hazard since you have already done it in the exit path), where it remains for two Turns (and can be range or kamikaze attacked, similar to dropstones).

This is the most fuel efficient route to exit the solar system, but leaves the starship in the inner solar system for a vulnerable two years. The initial flyby of Jupiter kills the ship’s orbital velocity, allowing it to plummet towards Sol. This takes 1.1 years, and the engine is ignited at perihelion, when it is closest to Sol. The resulting Oberth force multiplier and continued thrust takes it clear of the solar system, with a final pass at Jupiter again.\nTIP: Freighters have a net thrust of 1, are pushable with Powersat, and do not track fuel consumption.\nIf a Promoted Freighter is part of the desperation starship, the commander’s\nMobile Factories retain the characteristics of that Freighter card.

This is because the starship brings with it the seeds to start microbial life afresh, on a distant planet, so that it is Bios:Genesis once again.\n15PROJECT DAEDALUS was a design study for an unmanned interstellar spacecraft that could carry a mass 10 payload to a nearby star in half a century. The starship used terawatt fusion engines using isotopes of helium-3 and deuterium as fuel. The game Interstellar uses a version of Project Daedalus is upgraded to be able to carry humans and able to actually halt at the target star system.\n–A Bond & A Martin, Project Daedalus - The Final Report on the BIS Starship Study, 1978..\nEXAMPLE [4E3d] In a 5-player game the isototal is 50 isotopes.

See C8 in the Interstellar rulebook:\n• Winning the Module 4 Game (C8b), This awards the patron medallion and you choose who is the first mate.\n• Contributing the Most Isofuel (C8c), This awards the command medallion and you choose who is in command.\n• Contributing a Promoted TW Thruster (C8d), You start with the propulsion medallion.\n• Having Augmentations (C8e), These enable your passengers on Exodus to start augmented.\n• Glory & Medals (C8f). These are worth 1 VP each in Interstellar.\nc. Select Equipment. If there exists a Promoted Freighter, Promoted Bernal, and/or Promoted TW thruster anywhere, one of each are requisitioned for Project Exodus.\n• Contributing a Promoted Freighter (C8g), Exodus starts with a “skinny” wardens blueprint, which allows you an extra slot.\n• Contributing a Promoted Bernal (C8h), Exodus starts with a “skinny” life-support blueprint, which allows you an extra slot.\nd. Map Exit (C8i,j). Taking the Jupiter-Sol-Jupiter exit (or if no exit was made) starts Exodus at speed = 0, but taking other exits starts Exodus at speed = ½. Taking the Sol Oort exit also allows a free reconnaissance (C8k).\ne. Interstellar Starship Wet Mass (C8l). Exodus starts with a variable amount of fuel, depending on how much the player’s have jointly contributed per 4C4d.\n16\n16PAYLOAD COST. A starship of mass 10 (400 tonnes) traveling at its game maximum (15% lightspeed) would have a kinetic energy of 18 trillion joules. Every kilogram of payload on the starship that is accelerated to this speed would need 150 kilograms of isofuel releasing 45 million joules. This is equal to the total global energy usage each month in 2020, mostly from gas, oil, and coal. Converted to power, the 2020 global power demand of 17 terawatts is much less than the power of a starship engine (50 TW for Daedalus 1st stage, 4 TW for the 2nd stage). To achieve a delta-v for a cruising speed of 15%c, and assuming Daedalus engines with an exit velocity of 3%c, the mass ratio equals 150. This means that if one astronaut was 10 kilos overweight, it would cost the expedition man-years of miners and refiners to produce the additional one and a half tonnes of pure isotope fuel.\nTIP: Consider a map exit if making an Ad Astra Future with that exit or by making the desperation starshot (4C3c). [4E4d]\nEXAMPLE [4E3e] Players Purple, Green, and Player White all have Promoted Bernals. Player Purple also has the Daedalus TW thruster, which has the highest base thrust (11) and therefore chosen as the engine for Exodus. Player Purple thus holds the “propulsion” equipment medal, making him ineligible to hold the Bernal medal. SInce Player White is trailing in overall VP, he decides to award Player\nWhite with the “Bernal” equipment medal."

Morality is inapplicable to beings (such as animals other than humans) that cannot make moral or immoral choices. Just as in the creation of conscious humans as simulated in Bios:Origins, conscious robots are created by the conceptual and technological facility of using language to create a simulated mental landscape on which to make choices. The crucial aspect of consciousness is that it empowers the being to overwrite its own programming and adopt its own values. The fact that humans (and no other animal) commit suicide or become celibate hermits overwrites 500 million years of natural selection programming to survive and spread genes. The assumed value that the robot majority are assumed to pursue in this game is knowledge, thus the exclusivity of experience and Futures in victory accounting.\nEASILY MISSED: If your exomigration is limited by the lack of suitable Colonists, you must wait until one is available.

[4G3]\nMODULE 4 - EXODUS | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | 37 a. Early Rockets. Boosting quickly allows nabbing the easy Glory chits, which makes paleoconservative directive (O5b) extremely attractive. Module 4 adds new advantages to early missions. If you are the first with an Operational rocket, you will have an edge in bidding for and fulfilling contracts, providing funding, VP, and Abilities. Players without early rockets may try to influence politics to keep those contracts unavailable.\nb. Timing. As contracts need to be boosted, it’s best to take a contract when you have something else to boost: your initial rocket, an improved component, etc. The number of Operations you can perform in a game is limited, so do as much as you can with each one!\nc. Hazards. When bidding on (and fulfilling) a contract, all of the concerns for any High Frontier mission apply: radiation hardness, Mass, Burns, Hazards, and landing/liftoff. In particular, don’t forget that the contract has its own Mass and rad hardness! If a contract with the \"Humans on Board\" icon suffers involuntary\nDecommission, you suffer severe default penalties (4B6) along with the loss of equipment.\nd. Turn Order. Players after you in turn order have an advantage; they effectively get an extra turn to complete the contract. If these players are likely to bid, make sure you have a useful second operation planned if you do not win the contract auction. If they do win, starting another auction next turn is often a good idea - unless they complete their contract very quickly, they will be unable to bid.\ne. Bait. Contract auctions are also great opportunities to encourage opponents to make a mistake, or to nudge them away from your mission goals. Tempting an opponent with the right contract may distract them from some other goal they should be pursuing - or even cause them to bid too aggressively and default. The price of acquiring the wrong contract is much higher than that of buying the wrong patent. Think carefully when you bid.\nf. The Best Contracts. Contracts are central to Module 4. What makes one contract better than others? • Going My Way. The best contracts are those that have low opportunity cost because you were planning to go in that area anyway. “Return” contracts are often easier to take in the early game because you’ll probably be returning to LEO anyway. Later in the game, contracts must be judged in terms of return on investment:\nwhat else could you be doing?\n• Abilities. Important in the early game. Bailout saves you 3 Aqua - or a critical card - each time budget cuts occurs. Insight (cycle a deck before a research auction) helps get the cards you need and/or buries cards your opponents want. Other Abilities (such as on contracts involving Mercury) may change your plans entirely.\nTIP: The contracts with a subsurface ocean destination are common, making\nCeres a common early destination. If your own goals include Ceres, watch the contract market and the politics to acquire such contracts, or keep them out of enemy hands. [4He]\n• Aqua Advance. Important especially as the game progresses. Watch for contracts that match what your opponents are doing and keep the Active Law away from them.\n• Victory Points (VP). Contracts are worth Victory Points - but usually, building Factories and Colonies is worth more. If you who pursue nothing but contracts, it is unlikely that you will win. Instead, try to leverage contracts to accelerate your industrialization efforts without letting them distract you from that goal."

      "text": "4H2. Planning Tips (Modules 1 + 2 + 4 Games) a. Goals. A Module 4 game has 3 extra steps that you may need to get into an advantageous endgame position:\n• Fulfill Contracts. (Module 4). Enough to gain 4-5 icons, including at least one of each type and no more than 2 of each type.\n• Get Factories. (VP, ET Produce)\n• Get Bernals. (VP, Aqua; VP and operations through Colonists)\n• Augment Colonists. (Module 4)\n• Transport Augmented Colonists to Promotion Locations (Module 4)\n• Get TW Thruster. (movement)\n• Get Futures. (VP) b. Long-Range Planning. Your Turns are often either Operation-limited or movement-limited. Try to combine both in a Turn, for instance ET producing cards while moving a contract to its destination.\n• Operations. Contracts require Operations to acquire and boost (as with patents, it’s better for you to win an auction that someone else started, to save yourself an operation), but give you Aqua - which in effect saves you Operations that you would have otherwise spent selling cards or fundraising.\n• Movement. Fulfilling contracts requires a lot more rocket movement. The more you can align that movement with other missions (industrializing, moving Bernals, etc.), or perform it when you are operationlimited (such as while you are ET Producing, or buying cards to launch a Bernal), the faster your game will progress.\nc. Contract Variety. With the contract icon requirements for augmentation (and thus for Promotions), choosing a variety of contracts is much more important than in Core+M0 games. Fortunately, there are multiple valid paths. Getting an early start on contract diversity can be quite useful. The Political Assembly can fill up quickly, making it harder to move the Active Law. If you can fulfill contracts before the Active\nEASILY MISSED: A contract with a heavy mass eats profits with a heavy boost cost, and greatly complicates landing and liftoff. [4H1f]\nLaw gets stuck, or before the isobank, you are one step ahead. Alternatively, waiting for (or causing) the construction of the isobank leads to contracts which are harder to fulfill, but which have more icons.\nd. To Bernal or Not To Bernal. One of the nice things about High Frontier 4 is the balance between “Bernal first” and “Factory first” strategies. Both are reasonable - and often, doing the one fewer people have chosen is the best option. Everyone needs a Bernal (probably a Home Bernal), and everyone needs Factories, but which has primacy is opportunistic. Module 4 changes this balance a bit:\n• Early Bernal. If you focus on an early Bernal, you gain an early Colonist, and early Bernal profits which can be used while you launch your Factory mission. Since a Bernal is needed for the implant operation, you can pick and choose the right augmentations as they appear to augment your Colonists.\n• Early Elevator Bernal. Anchoring one of the two elevator Bernals (GEO Elevator or Lofstrom Loop) are tremendously helpful with contracts, as you can boost directly to Bernal with no cost increase. Don’t forget that Module 4 adds an Epic Hazard Roll when Anchoring these in home orbits!\n• Early Rocket. Since you need a Spacecraft to complete a contract, an early Rocket leads to early contracts and their advantages (see 4H1a). You can also establish an early Colony in space (i.e. not a Home Bernal), which is necessary for drawing from the new spaceborn Colonist deck and implanting augmentations."
