Freighters are a new type of patent card allowing the transport of valuable factory goods back to LEO. GW/TW thrusters are more powerful and efficient versions of the MW thrusters of the core game, allowing your Spacecraft to reach the outer planets more easily. This module also optionally introduces Futures, special game goals to earn victory points."

Every card with a Purple-Side has a dome icon to the left of the Thrust triangle which indicates the type of Colony at which it may promote. To use the promote operation, an unpromoted card (Bernal, Colonist, Freighter, or GW thruster) must either be at a promotion colony specified by its dome icon, or at a Lab:\na. Promotion Colony is a Colony at a type of Site indicated by a cardâ€™s dome icon. There are 5 types: \nSpectral Colony if at the specified Spectral Type (D, H, S, etc.).\nSubmarine Colony (waves icon, see glossary). \nAstrobiology Colony (leaf icon, see glossary).\n Atmospheric Colony if at a Site with the cloud icon (see glossary). \n Push Colony marked with the push icon (in the Heliocentric Zones of Earth, Venus, or Mercury, plus Io).\nb. Lab Promotion Site (Module 2). A Promoted and Anchored Bernal is always a valid promotion colony for Colonist, Freighter, and GW thruster cards (2A3c).\nc. Negotiation. To promote, the Colony must either be your color or be an opponent's color as a negotiated on-site operation (N6).\nd. Decommissioning Promoted Cards. Except for Robot sales (2C2a) and Robot transfers (Nb), Purple-Side cards cannot be sold on the free market (I3b) or included in a stack transfer (N3). They can be involuntarily Decommissioned, but see (1B7) and (2C2). They can be voluntarily Decommissioned (Felony for Human Colonists) and then sold or transferred from your Hand (except Human Colonists). They return to play on their White-Side or Black-Side by being boosted (Bernals), exomigrated (Human Colonists), or ET Produced (Robots, Freighters, and GW Thrusters).\nEASILY MISSED: The PurpleSide contains Futures, which are ignored unless you are using 1D (1A5d).\nEXAMPLE [1A5a] You build a push colony on Mercury north pole. This is a promotion colony for your Freighter (HIIPER beam rider), so you use it to fly your Crew to Mercury, use your Crewâ€™s thrusters to bring the Freighter to the surface, and perform the promote operation to flip the freighter card to its Purple-Side (magnetic mirror beam rider)."

      "text": "1B6. Freighter Promotion & Mobile Factories To flip a built Freighter card to its Purple-Side, perform a promote operation (1A5). Promotion is permanent.\nOnce Promoted, your Freighter card becomes a â€œfreighter fleetâ€ that then â€™convertsâ€™ all of your map cubes (big and small) into Mobile Factories. As Mobile Factories, all your Factories (big & small cubes) can now move like your Freighter and create a Factory by landing on one of your Claims. This change occurs the instant the Freighter card is promoted.\na. Capacities. Your small cubes now have all the characteristics of the Freighter card, including Mass (relevant if the cube is being carried as Cargo), rad-hard, Bonus Pivots, and On-board Nuclear Supports. Your small cubes may not carry Cargo (load limit does not apply) or use your Freighterâ€™s Future.\nâ€¢ Stacks, A Mobile Factory can be added or subtracted to a Stack as Cargo using cargo transfer (G1).\nb. Mobile Factory Landing & Lift-Off. To land or lift off a Claim without a Factory, a Mobile Factory cube may use factory-assist (H6c), using itself as the Factory. The Claim can be either yours or an opponentâ€™s, and must be on a Site of Size 5 or less (because all Size 6+ Sites have Lander Burns). See rocketplane exception below.\nâ€¢ Landing On Unindustrialized Claim, place Mobile Factory cube on top of the Claim disk. â€¢ Landing On Industrialized Claim (or a foreign Claim), place Mobile Factory cube next to the Claim disk to indicate that it is not part of the current Claim, and canâ€™t be used for ET production, colony establishment, or factory stock prices.4 CLAIMS are much more than a flag and footprints, and include considerable mining infrastructure, plus landing and launch facilities capable of accommodating Mobile Factories.\nEXAMPLE 1 [1B5] Your lunar factory produces a rotary dirt launcher freighter, which provides an electric \"e\" generator. Luna is too big for the Freighter to liftoff from, so you also produce a GW thruster (spheromak 3He-D magnetic fusion). The generator required by the GW thruster is provided by the Freighter. The GW thruster, carrying its supports (radiators and the Freighter), plus one tank of H isotope fuel, blasts-off and flies to LEO in one Turn.\nEXAMPLE 2 [1B5] In the previous example, the Freighter was used exclusively as an on-board nuclear support. But suppose the example had been at a distant H Site, say the Uranus aerostat. The GW thruster would be used just to get the Freighter and supports boosted through the three lander burns. Then it could be Decommissioned for use elsewhere, leaving the Freighter to bring a Black-Side support back to Earth to sell.\nEASILY MISSED: If you promote your Freighter, each of your factory cubes can move just like your big cube. [1B6a]\nMODULE 1 - TERAWAT T | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | 11\nâ€¢ Acetylene Rocketplane. A Freighter or Mobile Factory on an Atmospheric Site with a Claim may use acetylene rocketplane liftoff (H6c) by spending the water cost indicated from FTs stored at the Site.\nc. Factory Establish or Abandon. Your Mobile Factory is a Factory only if it sits on top of your Claim disk. Moving a cube on or off of your own Claim immediately establishes or abandons a Factory, adjusting the relevant Exploitation Track (I7d). You cannot abandon a Dirtside Factory if this leaves a Bernal without a Dirtside.\nâ€¢ When the last Factory of a Spectral Type is abandoned, the stock price becomes 10.\nd. Colonies. Any Mobile Factory, big or small, can be colonized. Because Colonies are permanent (G6b), Mobile Factories may not liftoff or abandon a Claim or be voluntarily decommissioned if they are on a Claim disk that has a Colony.\ne. Flares & Radiation Belts. Each Mobile Factory cube has a rad-hardness equal to your Freighter card rad-hardness, making it vulnerable to flares (K2d) and Belt Rolls (H10). If a small cube fails the roll, it is discarded. If a big cube fails, see Freighter Decommission (1B7). If a card carried in a Freighter Stack fails, the entire stack suffers a Glitch instead of Decommission, and suffers nothing if it is already glitched.\nf. Pad Explosion. A Mobile Factory is immune to pad explosions/space debris (K2c). g. Mobile Factory Creation is by the industrialize or nanofacture operations (1A7)."

The asteroid is size 4, so you use factory-assist to launch the Freighter card and its Cargo, which flies past the Burn Space next to Vesta.

      "text": "1B9. Space Elevators\nA Space Elevator6 is a cable which can be built between two map Spaces, as indicated on the map by the space elevator icon. To build a Space Elevator, one of the Spaces must be industrialized, and you must have a cube (Factory, Freighter, or Mobile Factory) at the other. Then you must perform an epic hazard operation (1A6), and if its roll is successful place a wooden elevator stick over the map icon. BIG CUBE SWAP represents using a 3D printer to reconfigure a Mobile Factory into a cargo-carrying freighter. Essentially its hull is reconfigured into a cargo bay, using existing material (since no mass is transferred in the swap). At the end of the â€œswapâ€, one should be left with two freighters with cargo-bays. But because of logistics limits, you can only have one freighter so the old one reverts to a Mobile Factory.\n6SPACE ELEVATOR is a tether held vertical by centrifugal force, from the equator of a world into deep space. It is tapered so as to support its own weight over its length. A variant is the spaceline, a tether dropped from a convenient tidally-locked moon, where the moon itself is a source of building materials and acts as a counterweight. A spaceline simply hangs into both gravity wells from the Lagrange L2 point, and sees much reduced tensions which means it need not be massive or superstrong. Because the moon orbits at a somewhat different speed than the surface, the dirtside end is a hook or scoop that travels through the atmosphere of the larger world, with appreciable drag and thermal load. The drag lowers the altitude of the moon by an insignificant amount. Robonautic climbers bring mined material from either world, after which it can be electromagnetically catapulted further.\nâ€“Penoyre & Sandford, The Spaceline, a practical space elevator alternative Achievable with Current Technology, (draft version).\nEASILY MISSED: A big cube swap is a free action that mimics what happens during a promoted Freighter\nDecommission. [1B8]\nEXAMPLE [1B7b] Your Freighter Stack moves to your Home Bernal and does a free market of its Cargo card. It is Spectral Type â€œANYâ€, so the Freighter is not worth anything on the free market, so you Decommission it. It is unpromoted, so it goes into your Hand.\nEXAMPLE [1B8] Your Promoted Freighter has just delivered product to LEO. You swap the big cube in LEO with your small cube on Ceres. This magic was performed with the power of 3D printing.\nEASILY MISSED: Using a Space Elevator is not a move, it's a cargo transfer free action (G1) in which stack cards transfer between two locations connected by an elevator. [1B9]\nMODULE 1 - TERAWAT T | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | 13 a. Locations are as indicated on the map at Luna (aristarchus plateau/ lagrange L1),7 Mars (arsia mons caves/ phobos), Saturn (aerostat/prometheus), Uranus (aerostat/cordelia),8 Neptune (aerostat/despina), Pluto/ barycenter, Charon/barycenter, and Haumea/barycenter.9 b. Claims. Building a Space Elevator automatically Claims any unclaimed Site it connects to, even if it is Busted (replace the red disk with one of your own). If a connected Site has a foreign Claim, that Claim remains unless\nClaim Jumping (G4) is possible.\nc. Benefits. As a free action, any player owning a connected Factory can cargo transfer (G1) Humans and Cargo between either of its connected Spaces. They can negotiate this privilege for others.\nd. Endgame Victory Points. If a Factory is connected by a Space Elevator, its factory stock price (M2b) is doubled, regardless of who built the Space Elevator. Building Space Elevators gives extra VP in the beanstalk future (1D4d, 1D5l).\ne. GEO Space Elevator. The Space Elevator at Earth can only be built by anchoring the GEO Elevator Bernal (Module 2, 2B4i) in the GEO Home Orbit. This anchoring does not need an Epic Hazard op/roll or other requirement.\nf. Destruction. A Space Elevator is destroyed if at the end a Turn neither of its ends are industrialized, with the exception that the elevator stick for the GEO Elevator is not removed if its Bernal is voluntarily unanchored. LUNAR BEANSTALK combines lunar space elevators with solar-powered robonaut climbers, a system for lunar resource recovery. The space elevator ribbon, made of existing high-strength composites, is balanced about the Earth-Luna L1 Lagrangian point on the near side of Luna, and connected dirtside with surface tramways linked to lunar mining sites. Estimated capacity is 584 tonnes (15 Mass) or lunar regolith into GEO per year.\nâ€“Pearson, Levin, Oldson, Wykes, Lunar Space Elevators for Cislunar Space Development, 2005. RINGED PLANET BEANSTALK. Ring material is a significant hazard to space elevators on planets such as Saturn or Uranus, where the most suitable moons lie just outside several ring systems. By building a truss tower on the north pole of prometheus (on Saturn) or cordelia (on Uranus), the elevator can hopefully avoid destructive impacts. A ribbon made of â€œcolossal carbon tubesâ€ would be 440 tonnes, or Mass 10. Delivery of the clean fusion fuel helium-3 to Earth is estimated at 20 tonnes per year. â€“A.M. Hein, Project Icarus: Architecture Development of Atmospheric\nHelium 3 Mining of the Outer Solar System Gas Planets for Space Exploration and Power Generation, 2010.\n9HAUMEA rotates every 3.9 hours, fast enough to distort its shape into a triaxial ellipsoid. A space elevator anchored to its twirling equator has little need for a counterweight. This spin seems to be a legacy of an impact which created the Haumea collisional family, as well as Haumeaâ€™s rings and moons.\nEXAMPLE [1B9c] You have industrialized the arsia mons caves of Mars, and moved a Mobile Factory to phobos. By performing the epic hazard operation, and paying the programmers FINAO there is no risk, you build the Mars Space Elevator. Place an elevator stick.\nSPACE ELEVATOR [1B9]\nTIP: Mars can be an \"ant lion\" trap, unless you build the Phobos Space Elevator!\nIt is often easy to build a mass zero \"any\" freighter on Mars, and send it to phobos via rocketplane. With a Factory on arsia mons caves, and a Freighter on phobos (even if phobos is busted), it only takes an epic hazard roll to build the elevator and set up your \"Martian Bottled\nWater Company\".

      "text": "1C. GW/TW Thrusters\nA Gigawatt (GW) or Terawatt (TW) thruster cannot fuel using Aquas or dirt; it may only factory refuel at a Site with a Spectral Type matching its fuel isotope or with your isotope FTs (yellow beads) obtained from such a Site. If used to afterburn, spend one fuel step to gain one Therm of cooling plus the thrust addition listed in the GW afterburn icon (1C2). Otherwise, they create Rocket Stacks, move, and burn fuel as the MW thrusters in the core game.10 a. Movement-Modifying Supports. If a GW/TW thruster is activated, movement is not affected by movement-modifying supports (J5d).\n11 b. Iso-Standard. Until you have researched and ET produced a GW Thruster (or otherwise have one in space), you cannot produce any isotope FTs. Thereafter, all isotope FTs you produce are considered to be of that Spectral Type (called your iso-standard), and can only be produced at the appropriate Factory Site. You may not research or ET produce a GW/TW Thruster if you already have one. Once you have established your iso-standard, it can be changed only if you buy or ET produce a new GW thruster after selling or losing your original GW/TW thruster.12\n10NUCLEAR ENERGY is unleashed either by fission (splitting huge â€œhigh Zâ€ atoms) or fusion (lumping together small â€œlow Zâ€ atoms). Fission atoms include uranium, thorium, and plutonium, while fusion atoms include isotopes of hydrogen, helium, lithium, and boron. The specific energy of nuclear fuels used in the game are: 6Li-H and H-B fusion = 73 TJ/kg, uranium fission = 82 TJ/kg, D-T, 3He-D, and D-D fusion = 345 TJ/kg.\nThe chemical fuels used in the game are a million-fold lower: metastable He = 477 MJ/kg and H2-O2 = 14 MJ/kg. The positive charge on fusion fuel nuclei creates an electrical repulsion that must be overcome by temperature and confinement time in order for them to fuse together. Therefore, input energy is required to obtain output energy, and the ratio of the thermal energy obtained from fusion/energy injected to sustain the reaction is called a reactorâ€™s Q factor. At ignition, Q goes to infinity. GIGAWATT REACTOR SUPPORTS. The reactors in the game produce a few hundred MW of thermal power, enough to power a MW thruster. But not enough to power a GW/TW thruster. In fact, the reactor supports for GW/TW thrusters in the game are not used as power sources, but rather as initiators for the primary nuclear power chain. For instance, it could represent a MW laser that initiates a GW fusion reaction. The ratio of fusion power produced to initiator power is called the Q factor. GIGAWATT THRUSTERS burn pure nuclear fuel with no added propellant or open-cycle coolant. Thus, the burned fuel becomes the propellant (in this they are like chemical rockets). The fusion or fission fuels are rare isotopes, which must be purified by isotope separation.\nThe game makes the following (speculative) assumptions on where to find these rare isotopes: The fusion fuel boron-11 on D worlds, fusion fuels tritium and helium-3 on H worlds, fission fuel curium-245 and lead (useful as antimatter thermalizer) on M worlds, fission fuel uranium-235 on S worlds, and the fusion fuel lithium-6 on V worlds.\nJONâ€™S LAW: â€œAny interesting interstellar drive is a weapon of mass destruction.â€\nMODULE 1 - TERAWAT T | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | 15"

GW/TW Thruster Fuel A Gigawatt thruster can only fuel by cargo transfer (G1b) using your isotope FTs, or using factory refueling (I5b).\nHowever the Spectral Type of the Factory must match that of the GW/TW thruster. Factory refueling can also take place at your Bernal, if it has a Dirtside Factory of yours that is the proper Spectral Type.\na. Isotope Fuel Site Refueling. During factory-refueling (I5b), the refueling rate for isotope fuel is limited to isotope tank (yellow bead) per factory refuel operation unless otherwise stated (Futures, Colonist Abilities, etc.).\nb. Wet Mass Chit. A GW/TW thruster uses a yellow Wet Mass Chit to show it runs on pure fuel isotopes. A Spacecraft using Isotope Fuel cannot use lower grade fuels, such as water (F4b), or isotope fuel that does not match the Spectral Type of its GW/TW thruster.\nc. Specifying Isotope Fuel Spectral Type. You may have only one GW/TW thruster either in your Hand or in a stack at a time, and the Spectral Type of this card specifies the Spectral Type of all the isotope fuel you can produce, carry, and warehouse as isotope FTs (I5b).\n13You may not store more than one type of isotope fuel.\nâ€¢ Free Market of GW/TW Thruster. If your GW/TW thruster returns to the patent deck, all of your isotope FTs (gold beads) remain. They convert into your new Spectral Type if you obtain a new GW/TW thruster.\n13FUSION FUELS are a balance between how many neutrons they produce (bad) and how low is their ignition temperature (good). See footnote 19 (Starship Fusion Fuels).\nEXAMPLE 1 [1C1c] A GW dense plasma focus rocket sits on a Factory at hydra, a D spectra moonlet of Pluto. A factory refuel op yields one tank of D isotope fuel.\nPlayer Green builds a spheromak GW thruster on the Uranus aerostat, an H spectra gas giant. He builds a Rocket with Dry Mass 6 (including its supports), and during 3 turns of factory refueling loads it with 3 tanks of H isotope fuel (helium-3).\nThe Rocket is now transport class, so even with +6 afterburning, the net thrust (12 - 1 = 11) is insufficient to lift-off Uranus (size 11). The Rocket cannot use standard factory-assist liftoff because it enters a lander burn (G3b). It could use the acetylene rocketplane, but that would cost 18 FTs (at Uranus Aerostat) and a Hazard Roll. Instead, it chooses to jettison one step of fuel, and afterburn another step to bring it to scout class and a net thrust of 12.\nEXAMPLE 2 [1C1c]\n16 | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | MODULE 1 - TERAWAT T"

Colliding FRC Fusion Thruster. This TW thruster requires a generator, plus two reactors as supports (because its Q is low and its initiator energy requirements17 are high).\nb. Synodic Comets. Exceptionally, a Rocket with an activated TW thruster can enter or exit a Synodic Comet during any season.18\n17INITIATORS are used to set off a nuclear reaction in the same way that the primer in the base of a pistol cartridge is used to ignite the gunpowder. Initiators can be lasers, high energy particle beams or pellets, or antimatter. From a modular design viewpoint, it is fortunate that the reactors in the game designed to power a MW rocket are of the right power (a few hundred MW thermal) to initiate the fusion reaction of a GW rocket a thousand times more powerful than a MW rocket. The ratio of nuclear power to initiator power is called the Q factor.\n18STARSHIP FUSION FUELS release energy as their light atoms (usually hydrogen and helium) are fused together. Here are the most commonly considered starship fusion fuels:\nâ€¢ D-T. The fusion of deuterium and tritium has the lowest ignition temperature (40 million degrees K, or 5.2 keV). However, 80% of its energy output is in highly energetic neutral particles (neutrons) that cannot be contained by magnetic fields or directed for thrust. The resulting waste heat means prohibitively large radiators.\nâ€¢ 3He-D. The fusion of helium-3 and deuterium is the preferred starship fuel. It has a higher ignition temperature (30 keV), but generates 77% of its energy in charged particles, resulting in a substantial reduction of shielding and radiator mass. Due to a troublesome D-D side reaction however, neutrons comprise a small part of its energy (4% at ion temperatures = 50 keV), and moreover the energy density is 10 times less than D-T.\nAnother disadvantage is that, although deuterium is abundant and cheap, helium-3 is so rare that 240,000 tonnes of SWIV regolith scavenging would be needed to obtain a kilogram of it. Alternatively, helium-3 can be scooped from the atmospheres of Saturn or Uranus.\nâ€¢ D-D. The fusion of deuterium to itself occurs at too high a temperature (45 keV) and has too many neutrons (60%) to be of interest. However, the neutron energy output can be reduced to 40% by catalyzing this reaction to affect a 100% burn-up of its tritium and 3He by-products with D.\nIn this fashion, a huge iceball can yield enough deuterium to power a beehive starship.\nâ€¢ H-11B.The fusion of 10% hydrogen to 90% boron-11 has an even higher ignition temperature (200 keV) than 3He-D, and its energy density is even smaller. Its advantage is that it suffers no side reactions and emits no neutrons, and hence the reactor components do not become radioactive.\nBoron-11 is the most common isotope of boron, obtained by processing seawater or borax. See example 1C3 for an H-B starship.\nâ€¢ 6Li-H. The fusion of lithium-6 to hydrogen is similarly aneutronic. However, both the H-B and 6Li-H reactions run hot, and thus ion-electron collisions in the plasma cause high bremsstrahlung x-ray losses to the reactor first wall. This can negate their low waste heat advantages.\nEXAMPLE [1C3] A Rocket Stack contains an 8â€¢0 thruster, with a â€œthrust +5â€ afterburn. If the net thrust is 8, this TW thruster can expend zero fuel and move 8 burns or one step and move 13 burns.\nEASILY MISSED: A TW thruster must use the same isotope fuel as its GW thruster did (flip the card over if you forgot which Spectral\nType this is).

An orchestrated collision would be useful to study black hole conditions.\n22MASS BEAM uses a column of neutral sodium atoms for propulsion, which gives far more â€œoomphâ€ than a beam of energy. FUSION CANDLE uses a gigantic TW â€œcandleâ€ thruster to push the gas giant itself out of the solar system, carrying its colonized moon Triton as an arkship.

Neutrino focusing is better than photon focusing, since neutrinos zip straight through Sol.\nEXAMPLE [1D4g] You promote your HIIPER freighter, move a mobile factory cube to the neutrino sunlens point, and finally perform the epic hazard op to get an orange star for the Star Wisp Future, worth 6 VP in the endgame if any cube is still in position.\n22 | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | MODULE 1 - TERAWAT T"

A factory floating in an atmosphere can liquefy valuable gases for propellants and fusion fuels. For instance, a hydrogen-balloon factory floating just beneath the clouds on Venus (see the Venus Site illustration on the map) extracts hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and possibly phosphorus from the â€œair de Venusâ€. Contrasted with the hellish surface, temperatures and pressures at such altitudes (50 km) are about Earth normal. Humans working outside the gondola wonâ€™t need spacesuits, only an oxygen tank and protection from the acid rain. On Saturn, a hot air balloon some 212 meters across would extract the rare isotope Helium 3 for use in clean fusion reactors back on Earth. Liquefaction of 2200 ton/yr of 3He-D fusion fuel, plus 4800 ton/yr of H2 propellant, requires 10 MWe, plus another 400 MWe for separation processes. These sites use windmills to take advantage of abundant winds (350 kph on Venus, 1440 kph on Saturn). They lie deep in the gravity wells, the escape delta-v is km/sec on Venus and 15 km/sec on Saturn. â€“Courtesy Peter Kokh, Moon Miners Manifesto, 2009.\n32DYSON BUBBLE is a swarm of sails that surround Sol in order to capture part of its power output.

Given the rather leisurely orbital velocities, around 4 km/sec, this is a â€œpoint and shootâ€ environment of vast distances and almost intuitive orbital mechanics. I have elected to model it with 4 burns to get up to speed (10 km/sec), and another 4 burns at the destination to decelerate for capture. Hohmanns in between represent the time to target. For the outermost part of the map, I allowed 10 burns to get up to 25 km/sec, then another 10 burns which could either be to accelerate to 50 km/sec for Solar System exit, or decelerate for capture at the EM sunlens.\n24 | HIGH FRONTIER 4 ALL | MODULE 1 - TERAWAT T"
