      "text": "This colonization module introduces orbital space colonies called Bernals (2B) and space pioneers called Colonists (2C). These two types of cards extend the core game to go beyond industrializing and exploiting the resources of the solar system to colonizing and settling the solar system. Bernals upgrade your Colonies to give you extra VP, based on the Hydration of nearby Factories. They also award Colonists, which you can take to Sites to perform extra Operations there. In addition these rules feature some extra advice and experimental rules for HF Core."

The classic 1970’s space station designs made famous by Gerald K. O’Neill and the movie 2001 have been slimmed down dramatically thanks to two discoveries: (1) equatorial low-earth orbit (ELEO) has very little radiation exposure, and thus a colony there requires little or no heavy radiation shielding, and (2) trained humans can tolerate 6 RPM, rather than the 1 RPM previously assumed. The result is a small station fabricated on Earth rather than with ET materials, with a population in the hundreds, and boosted by a few dozen superheavy-lift flights such as Falcon Heavy,\nSLS, or Long March 9. The game’s Bernal cards represent one of these designs with 100 residents, with Mass 40 fully loaded and Mass 10 empty – such as while under construction or dismantled for migration. Outside the Earth’s protective Van Allen Belts, a massive regolith shielding must be added, supplied by dirtside factories using railgun factory-assist. With buckets of rocks rather than delicate cargoes the throughput can be very high, allowing a full complement of shielding to be added in less than a year.\n–Al Globus, Stephen Covey, & Daniel Faber, Space Settlement: an Easier Way, NSS Space Settlement Journal, July 2017."

Home Orbits are Spaces near Earth marked with a 7-pointed star (B7b). If you boost a Bernal and Anchor it in one of these orbits, you gain many advantages (2B3, 2B4).\nc. Anchoring. Once Anchored by the anchoring operation (2A5), a Bernal becomes a Human Colony, gives you one Colonist in LEO/Home Bernal (2A6), becomes a destination for Dirtside ET products (2A7e), and changes all its Adjacent Factories into Dirtsides.\nYou have industrialized the buried glaciers and the caves of Mars. Then you anchor a Bernal in LMO (low mars orbit), which is Adjacent to both. They become Dirtsides, giving the Bernal a dirtside hydration (2B5) of 7. See figure 2B. COMPUTER GAMERS. Many of the workers in a Bernal will be teleoperators of robonauts, and may have learned their crafts by computer gaming. The advantage of having such persons near the mining facility is that the speed of light lag time is reduced from minutes to fractions of a second. WATER USAGE. Water is invaluable everywhere, but water consumption differs greatly on Earth versus in space. Essentially every drop of water used on Earth gets recycled, while essentially every drop used in space as reaction mass is lost forever. MOON TREATY. The ill-advised 1979 U.N.

You may not build a Robot in the rare case that you do not have a hapless Colonist to be replaced by a machine.\nYou build a Factory of Spectral Type D on the trojan asteroid menoetius. Your colonist limit is one: a security system robot on Luna, which you Decommission and resurrect (via ET production) on menoetius.

The ESA’s Schiaparelli Mars lander crashed on Mars in 2016 due to a programming error. After its parachute was deployed, it spun fast enough to briefly saturate its spin-measuring instrument, which caused activation of its on-ground system as if it had already landed, including early release of parachute and backshell, and a thruster fire for only 3 seconds instead of 30 seconds. On the other hand, a special emergency programming maneuver saved the Juno spacecraft as it was about to move into Jupiter’s shadow in 2019.
